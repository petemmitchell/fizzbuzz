A FizzBuzz Playground

This was a little bit easier for me to solve than I anticipated. I remembered
the assignment from F2 regarding turning arabic numerals into their roman
counter-parts, and vice versa. That required using the modulo comparison
operator in order to break down any given number. I used the same method here,
to a small scope.

I initially worked on my own, and then compared solutions with Derek and Javier.
They reminded me I needed to make this a method, not just a block of code.

I seem to have done better on this with Git.
